# AutoText Replacer

## Overview
The AutoText Replacer is a program that allows you to type specific trigger words (e.g., `/rec`) in any text field, and it will automatically replace the trigger with predefined sentences. This tool is designed to save time and effort by quickly inserting commonly used phrases.

2. **Use Triggers**:
   - Open any text field (e.g., in a browser, word processor, or text editor).

## Adding New Words

To add new trigger words and their corresponding sentences:

1. Open the `sentences.json` file in any text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code).
2. Add a new trigger and sentence in the following format:
   ```json
   {
       "/rec": "This is the predefined text to autopopulate.",
       "/greet": "Hello! How can I assist you today?",
       "/newtrigger": "This is the text for the new trigger."
   }
   ```
   - Make sure to follow the JSON format: each key-value pair is separated by a comma, and the file ends without a trailing comma.
3. Save the file.
4. Restart the program by closing the terminal and double-clicking the `app.py` file again.
